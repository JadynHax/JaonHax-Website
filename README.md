# Hey there!
Nice of you to stop by! I don't get many visitors here.

If any of my components have issues of any kind, this is a great place to tell me about them! Just make sure to link the relevant file when creating your issue so I can see what might be the matter with it. I'm going to keep this short for now, but I'll likely make it longer later.

### TL;DR
This is the place where I'm beginning to put all of my CSS, HTML, and JS for my Wikidot components.
